At lunchtime and in the evening, a six- or seven-course set menu is proposed, with an additional fantastic à la carte selection available in the evening. You can also compose your own four-or five-course set menu at lunchtime. The restaurant's bread and cheese trolley is renowned far beyond the city limits – the staff will enthusiastically talk you through the options."

Both menus end in a grand dessert finale, like seasonal confections as well as such classics as a cappuccino semifreddo served with brioche donuts. They do offer supplements using lavish ingredients, but unless you’re richer than Croesus, you needn’t consider them. Just put yourself in the chef's hands and relish a meal that is balanced, varied and as seasonal as it gets."

Finish with purple sweet potato baba au whisky cloaked with caramelized pecan whipped cream."

Every decision, every move, is in the service of his distinctive style, which many have copied but none have mastered. Fragrant white and black truffles, pearly beads of Osetra caviar, and vibrant garnishes make for brilliant touches that straddle the line between luxury and excess. Few have both the imagination and the know-how to make foie gras nigiri, and few serve abalone so meltingly tender. It is a captivating experience that is singularly memorable."

And all throughout, roaming bread and cheese carts are a reminder of a luxury that’s less and less common."

A quail egg, gently smoked and topped with caviar, is given a twist with barley caramel. Resting inside its shell, plump Maine uni, amplified with a divine peach gel and wasabi cream, is both stunning and memorable. The chef's creativity is on full display in an utterly unique Dungeness crab dish, while wagyu sided by a truffle-flavored doughnut with marrow glaze is yet another hit. Savory sweets, like new potato ice cream, a corn macaron with peppery nasturtium, or the dark chocolate tartlet studded with kombu, raise the bar."

His contemporary cuisine, based around resources from both the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, provides further surprises on the dessert menu, on which dishes somehow manage to combine the maritime world with sweeter textures (his “20 leagues under the sea”, a seaweed millefeuille presented inside a book by Jules Verne, is a particular delight)."

    "Description": "Ably assisted by two of his sisters (Esther often helps out in the kitchen while Sandra works front of house) and his nephew Jesús, Nacho Manzano invites us on a magical culinary voyage back to his origins, his roots, and the land of his birth, as he draws on the flavours of the Asturias region from a contemporary perspective. In this stunning, remote location surrounded by mountains, Casa Marcial is much more than a restaurant; it bears witness to the close bond the chef forged with his local environment during his childhood. Passion, respect, love and hospitality all contribute to a symphony of sensations on the à carte (featuring Casa Marcial’s signature dishes) as well as the tasting menus (Nordeste “El Cachucho”, Nordeste “El Fitu” and La Salgar), all of which focus on exquisite produce sourced in the Cantabrian Sea and zero-mile ingredients in a bid to support rural development. Standout dishes here include grilled teardrop peas with hake cheek and mushrooms, as well as the array of freshwater fish which are always cooked to perfection."

She often works with produce from her own garden or local suppliers and takes the time to create depth in her cooking. For example, she infuses beef stock with cinnamon, lemongrass, peanut and coriander to achieve a vibrant and subtly spicy flavour profile. This broth serves as a rich foundation to elevate chopped beef, rice noodles and daikon. With a choice of options for each course, the set menu is recommended to fully appreciate this aromatic cuisine."

In addition, a constant stream of innovations emerges from their laboratory, such as their “solid bubbles” or, even more remarkably, a “living table” that changes as the meal progresses (the latter experience is by prior reservation only). It could be said that, despite the superb ingredients on display, you probably come here more to enjoy the extraordinary overall experience and to admire the incredible expertise of Disfrutar’s chefs.

Special mention must be made of the wine list, which includes an extensive selection of French labels, of which both the sommelier and Giancarlo are huge fans. As a final attraction, make sure you find time to visit the Roman ruins in the basement.

    "Description": "The Adriatic Riviera, a perfect picture-postcard summer holiday destination, is the setting for this fine restaurant run by chef Mauro Uliassi. Hidden among the private beach clubs that crowd Senigallia’s seafront, this three-Michelin-star restaurant comes as a surprise, surrounded as it is by beach parasols and the sound of the sea lapping on the shore. The strength and originality of Uliassi’s cuisine lies in his ability to make good use of local ingredients, taking inspiration from the culinary traditions that have been so familiar and successful along this coastline over the past few decades and giving them a personal, creative twist. Fish and seafood obviously take pride of place, although there’s also room on the menu for meat, inspired by the Marche’s traditional game dishes – the delicious skewered pigeon is cooked to perfection! The colourful dining experience here is enhanced by the owner’s warm welcome, with Mauro’s sister Catia and his son Filippo working alongside the chef. It’s also worth mentioning that the restaurant has a keen focus on the environment, hence its banning of the use of plastic and doing its utmost to persuade its fish suppliers not to use polystyrene to transport their fish."

    "Description": "The cuisine at Pinchiorri is striking for its opulent and grandiose style which impresses without becoming overly fussy or excessive, so that the main focus in every dish is the flavour of its ingredients. The magnificent feast of courses resembles a firework display, with each course more impressive than the last in a growing crescendo of delights. It’s worth coming here simply to experience the service, an impeccable waltz directed by Alessandro Tomberli, one of the best maître-d’s in Italy. Annie Féolde, one of the restaurant’s icons, left the reins to the highly talented chef Riccardo Monco, who continues to nurture and satisfy the Italian appetite for fine cuisine. Credit must also go to Giorgio Pinchiorri, who has developed a wine list that is renowned across the globe."
